               <h4> Mercury</h4>
                <p>
                    Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, 
                    the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, 
                    and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's 
                    orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun 
                    means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. 
                    At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically 
                    displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. 
                    The synodic proximity of Mercury to Earth makes Mercury most of the time Earth's closest planet, despite Venus at times approaching Earth 
                    closer than any other planet can.

               <h4> Venus</h4>
                <p>
                    Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System. It has a surface gravity slightly lower than on Earth and has a very weak induced magnetosphere. 
                    The atmosphere of Venus, mainly consists of carbon dioxide, and is the densest and hottest of the four terrestrial planets at the surface.
                    With an atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface of about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth and a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F),
                    the carbon dioxide gas at Venus's surface is in the supercritical phase of matter. 
                    Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, 
                    making it the planet with the highest albedo in the Solar System. It may have had water oceans in the past, 
                    but after these evaporated the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.
                    The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation but convincing evidence has yet to be found.

               <h4> Earth</h4>
                <p>
                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
                    While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
                    About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, 
                    consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges,
                    volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes the magnetosphere of the Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds.

               <h4> Mars</h4>
                <p>
                    Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, 
                    being larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war.
                    Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust,
                    as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps.
                    It has two small and irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos.

               <h4> Jupiter</h4>
                <p>
                    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume.
                    It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets in the Solar System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface. 
                    The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than it receives from the Sun.
                    Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator.
                    The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.
                    A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at least 1831.

               <h4> Saturn</h4>
                <p>
                    Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). 
                    Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, 
                    a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. 
                    An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, 
                    but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.
                    The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 
                    500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on Neptune.

               <h4>Uranus</h4>
                <p>
                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, 
                    was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). 
                    It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, 
                    and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. 
                    For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets.

               <h4> Neptune</h4>
                <p>
                    Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, 
                    the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. 
                    Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. 
                    It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being Uranus). Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, 
                    it has no well-defined "solid surface". The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). 
                    It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.

               <h4> Pluto</h4>
                <p>
                    Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. 
                    It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, 
                    by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, 
                    Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Compared to Earth's moon, 
                    Pluto has only one sixth its mass and one third its volume.
